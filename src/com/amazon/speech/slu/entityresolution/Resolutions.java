/**
 * <p>
 * {@code Resolutions} is part of an {@link Slot}.
 * An Resolutions object represents the results of resolving the words captured from the userâ€™s utterance.
 * </p>
 *
 * For example:
 * <p>
 * User can define synonyms that should resolve to specific slot value
 * with the following sample json in their interaction model: <br>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *      "types": [
 *          {
 *          "name": "WeatherTypes",
 *          "values": [
 *              {
 *              "id" : "RAIN",
 *              "name" : {
 *                  "value": "rain",
 *                  "synonyms": ["shower", "storm", "rainstorm"]
 *              }
 *              }
 *          ]
 *          }
 *      ]
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In the above example, "shower" is defined as synonym for "rain".
 * When user says "shower", a response containing the following slot sample may be returned to the skill: <br>
 * <pre>
 * {
 *     "slots": {
 *          "WeatherType": {
 *              "name": "WeatherType",
 *              "value": "shower",
 *              "resolutions": {
 *                  "resolutionsPerAuthority": [{
 *                      "authority": "{authority-url}",
 *                      "status": {
 *                          "code": "ER_SUCCESS_MATCH"
 *                      },
 *                      "values": [{
 *                          "value": {
 *                              "name": "rain",
 *                              "id": "RAIN"
 *                              }
 *                           }]
 *                     }]
 *                 }
 *          }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In the above response json, "shower" is still passed as value to ensure backward-compatibility.
 * But "rain" appears as resolution value
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code Resolutions} is included for slots that use a custom slot type
 *  or a built-in slot type that have been extended with custom values.
 * Note that resolutions is not included for built-in slot types that you have not extended.
